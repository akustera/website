        <p>Welcome to the coder forge.</p>
        <p>These events hope to provide a place for adults to learn and trade as a
        `coder`. They are open to all, from complete newbies (noobs) to advanced
        programmers (guru's).</p>

        <p>There is no set curriculum and no costs either. Because of this these weekly
        meetups will be on an open door basis.</p>

        <p>As you can see this site is a work in progress, as is the project on a whole,
        but please do drop into our next <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Dublin-Coder-Forge/events/227966239/">forge</a> and see what it is all about.</p>
